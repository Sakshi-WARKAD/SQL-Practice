Types of SQL Commands :=

SQL (Structured Query Language) commands are categorized into different types based on their functionality. 
These categories help in managing databases, data, and users. Here are the main types:

### 1. Data Definition Language (DDL):-
   These commands define the structure of the database and its objects (like tables).
   - **CREATE**: Creates a new table, view, or database.
   - **ALTER**: Modifies an existing table or database.
   - **DROP**: Deletes a table, view, or database.
   - **TRUNCATE**: Removes all records from a table but keeps the table structure.
   - **RENAME**: Renames a database object.


### 2. Data Manipulation Language (DML):-
   These commands are used to manage data within database objects (like tables).
   - **SELECT**: Retrieves data from the database.
   - **INSERT**: Adds new data into a table.
   - **UPDATE**: Modifies existing data in a table.
   - **DELETE**: Removes data from a table.


### 3. Data Control Language (DCL):-
   These commands manage permissions and control access to the database.
   - **GRANT**: Gives user privileges to access the database.
   - **REVOKE**: Removes user privileges.


### 4. Transaction Control Language (TCL):-
   These commands manage the changes made by DML statements and ensure the integrity of transactions.
   - **COMMIT**: Saves the current transaction.
   - **ROLLBACK**: Reverts the current transaction.
   - **SAVEPOINT**: Sets a savepoint within a transaction to which you can later roll back.
   - **SET TRANSACTION**: Sets the characteristics of the current transaction (like read/write access).


### 5. Data Query Language (DQL):-
   - **SELECT**: Although part of DML, it is often considered separately as DQL since it is used only for querying data from the database.

These SQL command types work together to allow for the effective management and manipulation of database systems.
